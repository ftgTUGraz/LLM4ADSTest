# LLM4ADSTest
This is a collection of research papers about the application of Large Language Model (LLM) on scenario-based testing of automated driving systems. This survey not only reviews how LLMs are applied in scenario-based testing (e.g., phases, models, and strategies), but also investigates critical challenges (e.g., safety risks) and practical considerations (e.g., integration with industry-standard tools) to provide a holistic view of their real-world.
